# ðŸ§ª Phase 2 Testing Summary

**Complete testing strategy for Strategic Theme Scoring implementation**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Overview

Phase 2 introduces **strategic alignment scoring** that automatically prioritizes themes based on company strategy. Here's how to test it comprehensively:

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Testing (5 minutes)

### **1. Automated Test Script**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
./run-phase2-tests.sh

# Or run individual components
node test-phase2.js          # Core functionality
node test-browser.js         # UI testing (requires dev server)
```

### **2. Manual UI Testing**
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to:
# http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard/themes
# http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard/strategy-health
```

- [ ] Final priority = customer signal Ã— strategic alignment
- [ ] AI reasoning is clear and actionable

**Enhanced Theme Dashboard**
- [ ] Themes sort by strategic priority (default)
- [ ] Filter by in-strategy/off-strategy works

- [ ] Strategic context cards show conflicts/opportunities
- [ ] Recommendation badges display properly

**Strategic Analysis Modal**
- [ ] Modal opens with detailed analysis
- [ ] Strategic reasoning is displayed
- [ ] Conflicts highlighted in red

- [ ] Approve/decline actions work

**API Endpoints**
- [ ] `/api/admin/themes` returns strategic data
- [ ] `/api/admin/themes/strategic-health` works
- [ ] `/api/admin/themes/[id]/strategic-analysis` works
- [ ] Theme discovery with AI scoring works
- [ ] Error handling for invalid requests

**Strategy Health Dashboard**

## ðŸ§ª Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: High Alignment Theme**
```javascript
// Test data: Desktop accuracy theme
{
  name: "Enhanced Desktop Accuracy Features",
  description: "Better accuracy in takeoff calculations",
  tags: ["desktop", "accuracy", "calculations"],
  customerSignal: 85,
  expectedStrategicAlignment: 80+,
  expectedRecommendation: "high_priority"
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- Strategic alignment score: 80+
- Final priority: High (customer Ã— strategic)
- Recommendation: "high_priority"
- Conflicts: None or minimal
- Opportunities: Multiple strategic matches

### **Scenario 2: Off-Strategy Theme**
```javascript
// Test data: Mobile field access theme
{
  name: "Mobile App for Field Workers", 
  description: "Field workers need mobile access to view takeoffs",
  tags: ["mobile", "field", "access"],
  customerSignal: 86,
  expectedStrategicAlignment: <50,
  expectedRecommendation: "explore_lightweight"
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- Strategic alignment score: <50
- Final priority: Low (high customer Ã— low strategic)
- Recommendation: "explore_lightweight"
- Conflicts: Multiple strategic conflicts
- Opportunities: Minimal or none

### **Scenario 3: Mixed Alignment Theme**
```javascript
// Test data: Integration theme
{
  name: "Enhanced Integration Capabilities",
  description: "Better integration with construction software",
  tags: ["integration", "workflow", "automation"],
  customerSignal: 75,
  expectedStrategicAlignment: 60-80,
  expectedRecommendation: "medium_priority"
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- Strategic alignment score: 60-80
- Final priority: Medium
- Recommendation: "medium_priority"
- Conflicts: Some strategic concerns
- Opportunities: Good strategic fit

## ðŸ”§ Test Data Setup

### **1. Database Setup**
```sql
-- Run the test data setup
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-database -f setup-test-data.sql

-- Or copy SQL and run in Supabase SQL editor
```

### **2. Strategy Configuration**
```sql
-- Ensure you have an active strategy
INSERT INTO product_strategy (
  company_id, title, target_customer_description,
  problems_we_solve, problems_we_dont_solve, how_we_win,
  strategic_keywords, is_active
) VALUES (
  'your-company-id',
  'Desktop-First Construction Software',
  'Power estimators who need desktop accuracy',
  ARRAY['Takeoff accuracy', 'Desktop workflow efficiency'],
  ARRAY['Field execution', 'Mobile-first workflows'],
  'Best desktop accuracy and workflow efficiency',
  '[{"keyword": "desktop", "weight": 0.8, "reasoning": "Core focus"}]'::jsonb,
  true
);
```

### **3. Test Themes**
The setup script creates 3 test themes:
- **High Alignment**: Desktop accuracy (should score 80+)
- **Off-Strategy**: Mobile field access (should score <50)  
- **Mixed**: Integration capabilities (should score 60-80)

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: AI Scoring Not Working**
```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check console logs for errors
# Look for "Error calculating strategic alignment"
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify OpenAI API key is set
- Check API credits/billing
- Ensure network connectivity
- Check rate limits

### **Issue 2: Strategic Columns Missing**
```sql
-- Check if columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'themes' AND column_name LIKE 'strategic_%';

-- If missing, run migration
-- See minimal_v1_migration.sql
```

**Solutions:**
- Run the database migration
- Check table permissions
- Verify column data types

### **Issue 3: No Strategy Found**
```sql
-- Check if strategy exists
SELECT * FROM product_strategy 
WHERE company_id = 'your-company-id' AND is_active = true;
```

**Solutions:**
- Create test strategy in database
- Check company_id matches
- Verify strategy is active

### **Issue 4: Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check Redis connection
redis-cli ping

# Monitor AI costs
SELECT * FROM ai_cost_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify Redis is running
- Check AI cost limits
- Monitor response times
- Enable caching
