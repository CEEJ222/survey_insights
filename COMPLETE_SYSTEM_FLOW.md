## 📊 Layer 1: Feedback Collection

### **Input: Customer Voice**

```
Sources:
  - Surveys (email, web)
  - Interviews (transcribed)
  - Reviews (Trustpilot, G2, Google)
  - Reddit mentions
  - Support tickets (future)
```

### **What Happens:**
```typescript
Customer submits: "The dashboard loads really slowly with large datasets"

1. Store in feedback_items table
2. Link to customer profile (automatic)
3. Trigger AI analysis immediately
```

### **Database:**
```sql
feedback_items
  - id
  - customer_id ← Link to customer
  - content: "The dashboard loads really slowly..."
  - source_type: "survey"
  - created_at
  
  -- AI will populate these ↓
  - sentiment_score: NULL (pending)
  - ai_tags: NULL (pending)
  - priority_score: NULL (pending)
```

---

## 🏷️ Layer 2: AI Tagging (Real-Time)

### **AI Analysis Runs:**

```typescript
// Happens immediately after feedback submitted
async function analyzeFeedback(feedbackId: string) {
  const feedback = await getFeedback(feedbackId)
  
  // Generate raw tags
  const rawTags = await ai.generateTags(feedback.content)
  // ["dashboard", "slow", "data", "loading"]
  
  // Normalize tags (prevent duplicates)
  const normalizedTags = await ai.normalizeTags(rawTags)
  // ["dashboard", "performance", "data"]
  // (AI merged "slow" + "loading" → "performance")
  
  // Analyze sentiment
  const sentiment = await ai.analyzeSentiment(feedback.content)
  // { score: -0.7, label: "negative" }
  
  // Calculate priority
  const priority = await ai.calculatePriorityScore({
    text: feedback.content,
    sentiment: sentiment.score,
    customerTier: feedback.customer.subscription_tier
  })
  // 78/100 (high priority)
  
  // Update feedback item
  await updateFeedback(feedbackId, {
    ai_tags: normalizedTags,
    sentiment_score: sentiment.score,
    priority_score: priority
  })
}
```

### **Result:**
```sql
feedback_items
  - id: "abc-123"
  - content: "The dashboard loads really slowly..."
  - ai_tags: ["dashboard", "performance", "data"] ← TAGS
  - sentiment_score: -0.7
  - priority_score: 78
```

### **Why Normalization Matters:**
```
Without normalization:
  - "slow", "sluggish", "lag", "performance", "speed"
  - 5 different tags, fragmented data

With AI normalization:
  - All → "performance"
  - 1 canonical tag, clean data
```

## 🎯 Layer 3: Theme Discovery (Daily Batch)

### **The Problem:**
Individual tags don't tell the full story. We need to see patterns.

### **Theme Discovery Job (Runs Daily at 2am):**

```typescript
// Find clusters of feedback with similar tags
async function discoverThemes() {
  // Get all feedback from last 90 days
  const feedback = await getFeedback({ last: 90days })
  
  // Group by tag similarity
  const clusters = groupByTags(feedback)
  
  // Example cluster:
  {
    commonTags: ["dashboard", "performance", "slow"],
    feedback: [
      { id: "f1", content: "Dashboard too slow", tags: ["dashboard", "performance"] },
      { id: "f2", content: "Page hangs loading dashboard", tags: ["dashboard", "performance", "loading"] },
      // ... 45 more items
    ],
    uniqueCustomers: 47,
    sources: { survey: 34, review: 8, interview: 5 }
  }
  
  // If cluster has >5 items, generate theme
  if (cluster.feedback.length >= 5) {
    const theme = await ai.generateTheme(cluster)
    await saveTheme(theme)
  }
}
```

### **AI Theme Generation:**

```typescript
// AI analyzes the cluster
const prompt = `Analyze these 47 feedback items with tags: dashboard, performance, slow

Sample feedback:
1. "Dashboard takes 30+ seconds with large datasets"
2. "Activity feed widget is completely unusable"
3. "We're considering alternatives because of speed"
...

Generate:
1. Theme name (clear, descriptive)
2. Description (2-3 sentences)
3. Priority score (0-100)
4. Top 5 customer quotes
5. Recommended action

Return JSON.`

// AI Output:
{
  "name": "Dashboard Performance Issues",
  "description": "Enterprise customers with large datasets experiencing significant dashboard load times (30+ seconds), with the Activity Feed widget being particularly problematic. Multiple mentions of considering alternatives.",
  "priority_score": 87,
  "evidence": [
    "Dashboard takes 30+ seconds with large datasets",
    "Activity feed widget is completely unusable",
    "We're considering alternatives because of speed",
    "Our team has stopped using the dashboard",
    "Performance is our #1 complaint from customers"
  ],
  "recommended_action": "Optimize dashboard queries, especially Activity Feed widget for enterprise data volumes"
}
```

### **Stored in Database:**

```sql

## 💡 Layer 4: AI Insights (Weekly)

### **Insight Generation (Runs Weekly):**

```typescript
// Analyze themes and generate actionable insights
async function generateInsights() {
  const highPriorityThemes = await getThemes({
    priority: { min: 70 },
    status: "discovered" // Not yet addressed
  })
  
  for (const theme of highPriorityThemes) {
    const insight = await ai.analyzeTheme(theme)

# v2.4.0 - Performance Improvements
Released: January 15, 2024

## What's New

### Dashboard Performance Optimization ⚡

We've significantly improved dashboard load times, especially for
enterprise customers with large datasets.

**What changed:**
- Optimized Activity Feed widget (now 5x faster)
- Improved database query performance
- Added progressive loading for large datasets

**Why we built this:**
Based on feedback from 47 customers who reported slow dashboard
performance. This was our #1 requested improvement.

**Customer quotes that inspired this:**
> "Dashboard takes 30+ seconds to load with our dataset"
> — Acme Corp

> "Activity feed is completely unusable"
> — TechCorp

**Impact:**
- Dashboard now loads in <3 seconds (vs 30+ seconds)
- Activity Feed widget 5x faster
- Handles datasets 10x larger than before

Thank you to all 47 customers who provided feedback on this!

### **B. Track Validation (Daily Job):**

```typescript
// Run daily: Check if shipped features actually helped
async function validateShippedFeatures() {
  const recentShipped = await getRoadmapItems({

      period: { after: item.actual_ship_date, days: 30 }
    })
    
    const sentimentImprovement = sentimentAfter - sentimentBefore
    
    // Update roadmap item with validation
    await updateRoadmapItem(item.id, {
