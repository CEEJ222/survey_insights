## üöÄ Getting Started (2 Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: You're the First Developer (Sharing Your Code)

#### What You Need to Do:

**1. Push to GitHub**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project folder
cd survey_insights

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make first commit
git commit -m "Initial Survey Insights project"

# Create a repository on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/survey-insights.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**2. Share Repository with Collaborator**
- Go to GitHub.com ‚Üí Your repository
- Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Collaborators"
- Click "Add people"
- Enter their GitHub username or email
- They'll get an invitation email

**3. Share Supabase Credentials Securely**

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER send secrets via unsecured channels!**

**Safe methods:**
- Password manager (1Password shared vault)
- Encrypted messaging (Signal, ProtonMail)
- In-person / video call (read out while they type)

**What to share:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
```

You can find these in: Supabase ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API

**4. Decide on Database Strategy**

**Option A: Share Same Supabase Project** ‚≠ê Recommended
- Both see same data
- Easier collaboration
- How: Invite them in Supabase ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Team Settings ‚Üí Invite

**Option B: Separate Supabase Projects**
- Each has own data
- Independent testing
- How: They create their own Supabase project and run schema.sql

---

### Scenario 2: You're the Collaborator (Getting the Code)

#### What You Need to Do:

**1. Accept GitHub Invitation**
- Check your email for invitation
- Click "Accept invitation"

**2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
# Navigate to where you keep projects
cd ~/Documents

# Clone the repository (use the URL they give you)
git clone https://github.com/THEIR-USERNAME/survey-insights.git

# Enter the project
cd survey-insights
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
*This might take 2-5 minutes. That's normal!*

**4. Get Environment Variables**
- Ask your collaborator for the Supabase credentials
- They should send them securely (not via public channel)

**5. Create `.env.local` File**
```bash
# Create the file
touch .env.local

# Open it in your editor
code .env.local
# or
open .env.local
```

**6. Add the Configuration**
Paste this into `.env.local` (with the actual values your collaborator gave you):

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# App URL (for development)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Email (Optional - ask if you need this)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
# SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

**7. Setup Database**

**If sharing same Supabase project:**
- Nothing to do! The database is already set up

**If using your own Supabase project:**
1. Create new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
3. Copy all contents from `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Use your own Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

**8. Start the App**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser!

**9. Test It Works**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/signup
2. Create an admin account
3. Login and look around
4. If everything works - you're all set! üéâ

## üë• Daily Workflow When Working Together

### Every Morning (Before Coding)
```bash
# Get latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install any new packages
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### While Coding
- **Communicate**: "Hey, I'm working on the email templates"
- **Small commits**: Commit every time you complete a small feature
- **Test before committing**: Make sure your changes work

### Every Time You Finish Something
```bash
# Check what you changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Add email validation to signup form"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Before Taking a Break
- Push your changes (even if not perfect)
- Leave a note in your team chat: "Just pushed changes to survey form"

## üö® Common Situations & How to Handle Them

### 1. "Git push rejected"
**What happened**: Your collaborator pushed changes while you were working

**Solution**:
```bash
# Get their changes
git pull origin main

# If no conflicts, it merges automatically
# Now push yours
git push origin main
```

### 2. "Merge Conflict"
**What happened**: You both edited the same lines

**Solution**:
```bash
# After git pull, you'll see conflict markers
# Open the file in your editor

# Look for these markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your code
=======
Their code
>>>>>>> main

# Keep the correct version, delete the markers
# Save the file

# Mark conflict as resolved
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

**Pro tip**: Call/message your collaborator to decide which version to keep!

### 3. "My changes disappeared!"
**What happened**: Might have been overwritten in a merge

**Solution**:
```bash
# See recent commits
git log

# See all your actions
git reflog

# Your changes are probably still there
# Ask for help from someone experienced with Git
```

### 4. "Different data in our apps"
**What happened**: You're using different Supabase projects

**Is it a problem?** 
- **No, if intentional**: You each have your own test data
- **Yes, if unintentional**: One of you is connected to wrong database

**Solution**: Check your `.env.local` files match (if you're sharing a database)

### 5. "Package not found" error
**What happened**: Your collaborator installed a new package

**Solution**:
```bash
# Pull their changes
git pull origin main

# Install the new package
npm install

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Beginners

### Communication is Key
1. **Before starting**: "I'm going to work on X today"
2. **While working**: "Stuck on this error, can you help?"
3. **After pushing**: "Just pushed changes to X"
4. **Daily standup**: Quick 5-min call each morning

### Git Habits
- ‚úÖ Commit often (don't wait until end of day)
- ‚úÖ Pull before you start working
- ‚úÖ Push when you finish something
- ‚úÖ Write clear commit messages
- ‚úÖ Ask questions if unsure

### Commit Message Examples
**Good:**
- "Add email validation to signup form"
- "Fix survey submission bug"
- "Update README with new setup steps"

**Bad:**
- "changes"
- "fix stuff"
- "asdfasdf"

### Avoiding Conflicts
1. **Communicate** who's working on what
2. **Pull frequently** (every 1-2 hours)
3. **Work on different features** when possible
4. **Push regularly** so your teammate knows your progress

## üÜò When You're Stuck

### Debugging Checklist
1. **Read the error message** - It usually tells you what's wrong
2. **Check browser console** - Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
3. **Check terminal output** - Look for error messages
4. **Restart dev server** - Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`
5. **Check `.env.local`** - Are your values correct?
6. **Google the error** - Someone has probably solved it
7. **Ask your collaborator** - They might have seen it before
8. **Take a break** - Come back with fresh eyes

### Getting Help
- **Each other**: Your best resource!
- **Documentation**: README.md, SETUP.md
- **Google**: Most errors have been solved before
- **Stack Overflow**: Great for specific code questions
- **ChatGPT**: Can explain concepts and help debug
- **YouTube**: Great for visual learners
