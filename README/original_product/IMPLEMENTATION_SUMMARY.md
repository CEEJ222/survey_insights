# Implementation Summary: User Management & Signup Flow

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

I've successfully created a comprehensive free signup flow with company admin assignment and user management capabilities. Here's what's been built:

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Free Signup Flow
- **Location**: `/admin/signup`
- First user who signs up for a company automatically becomes the **Company Admin**
- Simple registration: Company Name, Full Name, Email, Password
- No payment required - completely free signup
- Auto-confirmation of email for faster onboarding

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Three distinct user roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Company Admin** | Everything + manage team members |
| **Admin** | Create/manage surveys, send surveys, view responses |
| **User** | View-only access to surveys and responses |

### 3. User Management (Company Admins Only)
- **Location**: `/admin/dashboard/users` (Team menu)
- Invite new team members with Admin or User roles
- Activate/deactivate users without deleting accounts
- Delete users permanently
- View all team members with their roles and status

## 📁 Files Created

### Backend (API Routes)
1. **`/src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`**
   - `GET` - List all users in company
   - `POST` - Invite new user to company

2. **`/src/app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`**
   - `PATCH` - Update user role or active status
   - `DELETE` - Remove user from company

### Frontend (UI)
3. **`/src/app/admin/dashboard/users/page.tsx`**
   - Complete user management interface
   - User invitation dialog
   - User list with role badges
   - Activate/deactivate/delete actions

## 📝 Files Modified

   - Added role constraint for `company_admin`, `admin`, `user`
   - Created comprehensive RLS policies for multi-user access
   - Updated survey/response policies for role-based access

### Authentication

### Signup Flow
9. **`/src/app/api/admin/signup/route.ts`**

   - Sets `is_active = true` by default

### Dashboard Navigation

    - Added "Team" menu item (visible only to Company Admins)
    - Imported Users icon from lucide-react

## 🔒 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only see data from their own company
- Company admins can manage users in their company only
- Cannot delete your own admin account
- Active status must be true to access data

### Permission Checks
- API endpoints verify authentication
- Role-based authorization on all sensitive operations
- Frontend hides features based on permissions
- Database enforces access at RLS level

### Data Isolation
- Each company's data is completely isolated
- No cross-company data access possible
- Enforced at database level, not just application level

## 🚀 How to Use
