## Next Steps

Now that everything is set up:

1. ‚úÖ Create more surveys
2. ‚úÖ Import bulk recipients via CSV
3. ‚úÖ Monitor response rates
4. ‚úÖ Analyze feedback patterns
5. üîÆ Plan AI integration for insights (future)

## Collaboration Workflows

### Setting Up for Multiple Developers

When working with another developer, here are the recommended workflows:

#### Initial Setup (First Developer)

**1. Initialize Git Repository**
```bash
# In the project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

**2. Create GitHub Repository**
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
- Click "New Repository"
- Name it `survey-insights`
- **Don't** initialize with README (you already have one)
- Click "Create Repository"

**3. Push Code to GitHub**
```bash
# Add the remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/survey-insights.git

# Push the code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**4. Share Credentials Securely**

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit `.env.local` to Git!** It contains secret keys.

Share environment variables with your collaborator via:
- Password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Encrypted message (Signal, ProtonMail)
- Secure note-sharing service

Share these exact values:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

---

#### Collaborator Setup

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
# Navigate to your projects folder
cd ~/Documents

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/survey-insights.git
cd survey-insights
```

**2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Create `.env.local` File**
```bash
touch .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` in your editor and paste the credentials your collaborator shared with you.

**4. Decide on Database Strategy**

**Option A: Share Same Supabase Project** (Recommended for collaboration)
- Both developers use the same Supabase project
- Same `.env.local` values
- See the same data
- Good for: Working together on the same features

**Option B: Separate Supabase Projects** (For independent development)
- Each developer creates their own Supabase project
- Different `.env.local` values
- Separate data
- Good for: Testing features independently without affecting each other

**5. Start Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

#### Daily Workflow

**Before Starting Work (Get Latest Changes)**
```bash
# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Install any new dependencies (if package.json changed)
npm install
```

**After Making Changes (Share Your Work)**
```bash
# Check what you changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add email validation to signup form"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Communicating Changes**
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Let your collaborator know when you push major changes
- If you both edit the same file, Git might create a "merge conflict" - don't panic!
  - Search "how to resolve git merge conflict" for help
  - Or ask your collaborator to help

---

#### Handling Merge Conflicts

If both of you edit the same lines of code, Git will ask you to resolve conflicts:

```bash
# You'll see a message like:
# "CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/app/page.tsx"

# Open the file in your editor. You'll see:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes here
=======
Their changes here
>>>>>>> main

# Delete the markers and keep the correct version
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

**Tips to Avoid Conflicts:**
- Work on different files when possible
- Communicate who's editing what
- Pull changes frequently (`git pull`)
- Push your changes regularly

---

#### Using Branches (Intermediate)

For cleaner collaboration, use feature branches:

```bash
# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/email-templates

# Make your changes...

# Commit changes to your branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add email template customization"

# Push your branch
git push origin feature/email-templates

# On GitHub, create a "Pull Request" to merge into main
# Your collaborator can review and merge
```

---

#### Database Schema Changes

If you need to modify the database structure:

**1. Update `supabase/schema.sql`**
```sql
-- Add your changes (new tables, columns, etc.)
ALTER TABLE surveys ADD COLUMN tags TEXT[];
```

**2. Run in Your Supabase Project**
- Go to Supabase SQL Editor
- Run the new SQL commands

**3. Commit and Share**
```bash
git add supabase/schema.sql
git commit -m "Add tags column to surveys table"
git push origin main
```

**4. Tell Your Collaborator**
- They need to run the same SQL in their Supabase project
- Message them: "Hey, I updated the database schema. Run the new SQL from schema.sql lines X-Y"

---

#### Shared vs Individual Supabase Projects

**Shared Project (Same Database)**

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- See same data
- No duplication of test data
- True collaboration

‚ùå **Cons:**
- Can interfere with each other's testing
- Both need access to same Supabase project
- Database changes affect both immediately

**Individual Projects (Separate Databases)**

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Independent testing environment
- No interference
- Can experiment freely

‚ùå **Cons:**
- Need to manage separate API keys
- Can't see each other's test data
- Need to keep databases in sync manually

**Recommendation for Beginners:** Start with shared project, move to individual if you're constantly stepping on each other's toes.

---

### Troubleshooting Collaboration Issues

**"Git push rejected"**
- Your collaborator pushed changes first
- Solution: `git pull origin main` then `git push origin main`

**"My changes disappeared!"**
- They might have been overwritten in a merge
- Check `git log` to see commit history
- Use `git reflog` to find lost commits

**"Different data in our databases"**
- You're using different Supabase projects
- Either share same project or keep them separate (by design)

**"Package not found error"**
- Your collaborator added a new dependency
- Solution: `npm install` to get the new packages

## Contributing

When you make changes, follow these practices:

1. **Test your changes** - Make sure the app still works
2. **Write clear commit messages** - "Fix email validation" not "fix stuff"
3. **Pull before you push** - Get latest changes first
4. **Communicate** - Tell your team about major changes
5. **Ask questions** - Better to ask than break something!
